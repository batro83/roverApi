# roverApi



##Stack
Springboot
Mockito

First of all I tried to initialize the project with map size, obstacles and the initial starting point of rover.
Reading the exercise I chose to make rover moves as a service

##Improvements

- Check init drop of rover
- Make Obstacles final
- Maybe try to refactor roverService and split it in one class per move, to be more readable.
